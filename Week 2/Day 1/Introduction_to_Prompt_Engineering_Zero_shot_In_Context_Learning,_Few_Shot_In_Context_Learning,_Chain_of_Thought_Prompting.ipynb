The total travel time for the teleported option is only 1 hour, while the flying option takes 5 hours. This means that Billy would have much more time left after reaching home if he selects the teleporter option.\n\nSince it is currently 1 PM local time, Billy should have enough time to select the teleported option, as it only takes 1 hour. This would allow him to reach home before 2 PM. Therefore, it does matter which travel option Billy selects, and he should choose the teleported option to optimize his travel time."
