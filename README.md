<h1 align="center" id="heading">:wave: Welcome to LLM Engineering - The Foundations!</h1>

Welcome to the beginning of your journey to becoming an LLM Engineer! 🎉 Excited to have you on your way to becoming an LLME practitioner! 

## What is LLM Engineering?

Large Language Model Engineering (LLM Engineering)  refers to the emerging best-practices and tools for training, fine-tuning, and aligning LLMs prior to production deployment.

LLM Engineering is the counterpart to ML Engineering (MLE) that focuses on LLM-specific techniques like prompt engineering, reinforcement learning, quantization, and other methods required by this new paradigm.

## 📚 About

This GitHub repository is your gateway to mastering the art of training, fine-tuning, and aligning LLM models like a pro. All assignments for the course will be released here for your building, shipping, and sharing adventures!

In this repository, we will dive deep into the best practices and technologies that empower LLM Engineers, to harness the full potential of LLMs. Here are just a few of the key methods and tools we'll explore:

#### Transformers
- Embedding
- Positional Encoding
- Add & Norm (e.g. Layer Normalization and Residual Connection)
- Feed Forward Network
- Multi-Head Attention (e.g., Scaled Dot-Product Attention and Forward Pass)
- Encoder and Decoder Blocks
- Linear Projection Layer

#### LLM Training & Fine-Tuning
- Training nanoGPT from scratch
- Fine-Tuning GPT-2
- Fine-Tuning Mistral 7B via PEFT-LoRA
  
#### LLM Alignment
- Instruct-tuning Llama 2
- RLHF implementation using recent [Open LLM](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard)
- RLAIF implementation
