Initially, it uses a higher learning rate to speed up learning, then gradually reduces it to make fine adjustments and avoid overshooting the best solution. This approach helps the model learn faster and more effectively, prevents it from getting stuck in less optimal solutions, and is more efficient in using computational resources."
